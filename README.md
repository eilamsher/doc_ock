## Abstract

The use of composite material is widespread in the aerospace industry, and is
expanding to other industries, due to their superb physical properties, among them is a
high strength to weight ratio. Alas, the manufacturing process of these materials is
complex, as they are made of two or more constituent materials, that require a specific
alignment for achieving maximal structural integrity. Non-destructive testing (NDT) is
used to verify correct alignment. These types of test require good access to scanned
surfaces, to ensure good and accurate coupling of the sensor and achieving proper
results. This access is hard to achieve when the component is a closed structure with
limited service hatches, e.g. aircraft wings.

The use of a robotic manipulator for performing NDT scans in closed complex
structures is ideal, though it requires many degrees of freedom (DOF) from the
manipulator, to allow safe navigation and maneuverability within the structure. A
robotic manipulator with these attributes is considered a hyper redundant robotic (HRR)
manipulator, a kinematically redundant manipulator, with a very large or infinite degree
of redundancy, analogous in morphology to tentacles or elephant trunks. The realization
of such a hyper-redundant manipulator is difficult due to various engineering problems.
Increasing the length and reducing the diameter of a hyper redundant mechanism, result
in a more complex design, and actuating the manipulator using motors in a conventional
method is limited. A power transmission from the manipulator base to its joints is
necessary to allow the design of an HRR manipulator with suitable measurements and
DOF.

The aim of this study is to design and build a working hyper redundant
manipulator prototype, as a preliminary step to the manufacturing of a full length HRR
manipulator. This study is meant to test and verify the validity of the design of the
manipulator, alongside its novel control model. The necessity for this study arises from
a need to improve the reachability and maneuverability of robotic manipulators, while
maintaining full controllability of all degrees of freedom.

In this research, the use of strings as tendons for the actuation of a novel HRR
manipulator was suggested and tested, and a design for a 2.5-meter-long, 65-mm
diameter robotic arm with 12 double angled joints providing 24 DOF was suggested.
The design included the mechanical design of the joints and links of the arm, and of a 9 motor string actuating system for a smaller prototype arm, the electrical design and
PCB design of a motor driving system, a rotary encoders reading system and a string
tension measuring system, and the development and implementation of a novel control
system approach for the kinematic manipulation of the tendon-actuated HRR arm,
which relies on estimating and controlling the length of the strings, treating all armâ€™s
joints together to overcome the coupling of the joints and the effect of their movements
on one another. Several experiments were conducted using the 3-joint 4-link HRR
manipulator prototype, built as part of this research, both in an upright position, which
reduces the effect of gravity on movement about the x axis, and a horizontal position,
which further tests the string tension control system. Alongside these achievements,
future research shall include the design and build of a string actuating system for 36
strings, for the actuation of the long 12 joint HRR arm, integration with the ultra-sonic
NDT scanning arm end effector, and further experimentation and improvement of the
control system.
